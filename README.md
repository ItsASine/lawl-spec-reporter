#Description

Spec reporter for jasmine, based on [jasmine-spec-reporter](https://raw.github.com/bcaudan/jasmine-spec-reporter/), outputs in LolSpeak

# Usage
## Protractor
The `lawl-spec-reporter` can be used to enhance your [Protractor](https://github.com/angular/protractor) tests execution report, utilizing the power of lulz.

##Warning
Very much a WIP at the moment, do not download pls.

#Customization

Have some project-specific words or phrases that you know could be lolified? Add them to the translation.json file!
